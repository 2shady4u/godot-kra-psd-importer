# godot-psd-importer

**!!!DISCLAIMER !!! WORK IN PROGRESS**

GDNative wrapper for Importing PSD-files into Godot 3.1+, making it possible to significantly speed up development when working with PSD-files. Additionally, it does not require any additional compilation or mucking about with build scripts.

This is the orphaned 'assetlib'-branch that serves as a disconnected branch from which the Godot Asset Library downloads
its files. For the branch containing the complete documentation, as well as instructions on how to contribute, please see:
